# FitnesApp
I made this project in relation to my Master's Degree. Everyone can use this application even non registered users. The main idea behind it is after a visitor opens the application and sees the site is legitimate and gives good information he'll register so that way he'll have more options. He can open the bmi calculator and he'll save logs from the times he check it with the  input values like age, height and weight. He can also apply for a trainer. Trainers on the other hand can setup a personal program and personal regime for each individual.They can even set the time a person takes a brake between sets. Trainers get the values they put inside a regime or program, from databases.
